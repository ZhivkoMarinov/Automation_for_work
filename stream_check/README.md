I have to check the livestream of some websites in every 30mins everyday. This tool automates the process.

  1. You can input links you want to loop through in stream_check.py by adding them in the 'urls' list
  2. PyAutoGui is used to click on websites option menu for the stream quality. You can configure the pixels you need to click on anything in mouse_function.py

Type "python stream_check.py" in cmd/bash in the directory, where the files are saved.
